# easyblogging
## About me
My name is Mauro and I made this system not only to learn things about PHP, HTML, CSS and so on, but also to have an easy blogging system for my website. The thing is I don't find blogging sites such as Blogger or Wordpress amusing, ans because of that I usually update those blogs once or twice to leave them.
I started this project on July 16th. At first I had to edit the index HTML manually so I started writing code to automatize this process.
## Third-party code
This blog uses TinyMCE for its posting interface, so the user has a WYSIWYG editor.
